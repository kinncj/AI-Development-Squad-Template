## CI/CD

Every pull request runs:

| Job | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **Lint** | `shellcheck` on all `.sh` files |
| **CLI Tests** | `ai-squad help`, `swarm help`, `init`, file count assertions |
| **Template Validation** | Structure, agent frontmatter, skills, commands |
| **Model ID Audit** | No stale date-suffixed IDs; Orchestrator/Architect use Opus |

The `ci-gate` job fails the PR if any of the above fail. PRs cannot be merged with a failing gate.

## Adding an Agent

### 1. Claude Code (`.claude/agents/{name}.md`)

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: One-line description shown in the agent picker.
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
---

You are a specialist agent in an orchestrated, phase-gated pipeline.

Hard rules:
- Only work on tasks assigned by @orchestrator.
- Never skip quality gates.
- Read relevant skills from `.claude/skills/` before executing tasks.
- After 3 consecutive failures, stop and report to human.
```

### 2. OpenCode (`template/.opencode/agents/{name}.md`)

```markdown
---
description: One-line description.
mode: subagent
model: github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5
temperature: 0.2
tools:
  write: true
  edit: true
  bash: true
permission:
  edit: ask
  bash:
    "*": ask
    "make *": allow
    "git status*": allow
    "git diff*": allow
    "gh *": allow
  webfetch: deny
---

[Same body as Claude Code agent]
```

### 3. Register the agent

- Add to `permission.task` list in `template/.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md`
- Add a row to `template/AGENTS.md`
- Update the agent count in `README.md`

### 4. Add a test

The test in `tests/template/test_agents.sh` validates frontmatter automatically for all agents. If your agent has special requirements, add an assertion there.

## Model Assignment Rules

| Role | Claude Code | OpenCode |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator, Architect | `claude-opus-4-6` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` |
| All implementation agents | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5` |
| Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `copilot/gpt-4.1` |

Never use date-suffixed model IDs (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`). The CI model audit will catch these.
