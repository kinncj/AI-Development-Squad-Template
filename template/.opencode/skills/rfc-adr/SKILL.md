## When to Write an ADR
- Choosing between two or more non-trivial technical approaches.
- Adopting a new technology or framework.
- Changing a significant existing pattern.
- Making a trade-off with known long-term implications.

## When NOT to Write an ADR
- Obvious choices with no real alternatives.
- Implementation details within an agreed-upon approach.
- Temporary decisions expected to change soon.
